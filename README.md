# PI Throughput/Velocity Chart

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/krmorse/PIVelocity.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/krmorse/PIVelocity)

This app plots the velocity or throughput of portfolio items based on their ActualEndDate.  Metrics can be calculated using a variety of rollup fields (LeafStoryPlanEstimateTotal, RefinedEstmate, Count, etc.).  The app can be configured for any level of the portfolio item hierarchy and the x-axis granularity is configurable as well.  This app includes the standard filtering component to enable further slicing and dicing of data.

## Deprecation Notice

This app has been forked into the RallyCommunity organization and is no longer maintained here.  The latest app code may now be found here: https://github.com/RallyCommunity/PIVelocity
